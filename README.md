# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ASSIGNMENT

Assignment with multiple scenarios. For further details on each scenario, open one of the sub-folders. 

## RL1:
In this part of the assignment, you will get familiar with the environment by implementing a simple random agent. This will be the first step towards setting up a loop with your agent and the environment, which will be useful in the subsequent exercises.

## RL2:
In this part of the assignment, a greedy Q-learning agent is implemented. 

## RL3:
In this part of the assignment, the hyperparameters of Q-learning are experimented with and the best resulting values are kept. 
Two scenarios are kept:
1. Never catch any fish, including the kingfish. Hyperparameters for this can be found under student_3_2_1.py, and they can be pasted into settings.yml before running. 
2. Taking the shortest path to catch the kingfish. Hyperparameters for this can be found under student_3_2_2.py, and they can be pasted into settings.yml before running. 

## RL4:
In this part of the assignment, a linear and constant epsilon greedy are implemented to address the exploitation-exploration dilemma. 

## RL5: 
Final submission to the assignment with the best resulting techniques and hyperparameter to escape suboptimal policies can be found in settings.yml.  
1. Alpha = 0.5
2. Gamma = 0.9
3. Constant epsilon = 0.2
